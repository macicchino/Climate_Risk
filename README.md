Personal Project Analyzing Real Time Climate Events
https://macicchino.github.io/Climate_Risk/

## Step by Step

1. Integrate Live Hurricane Updates:
- Choose an API for live hurricane data (e.g., National Hurricane Center or OpenWeatherMap).
- Write JavaScript code to fetch and display this data on your map.
2. Add Manufacturing Base Markers:
- Find a dataset with the coordinates of major manufacturing bases in the U.S.
- Use a mapping library like Leaflet.js to plot these locations on your map.
3. Test and Iterate:
- Push your changes to GitHub and check your live site to ensure everything is working as expected.
- Make adjustments as needed based on your testing.
